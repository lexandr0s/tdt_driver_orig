Mailbox syncronization protocol
-------------------------------

sync(in myMailbox, in token, out yourMailbox)
	# preserve the original mailbox settings
	oldSettings       = myMailbox

	# present the token for the other CPU to find
	myMailbox.enables = token
	myMailbox.status  = 0

	# try to find the token in another CPUs mailbox registers
	yourMailbox = FIND token IN yourMailboxList USING enables

	# if this was successful we must nofity our partner using
	# their status register
	IF SET yourMailbox
		yourMailbox.status = token

	# wait until our partner notifies us that they have found
	# our token (this can be implemented by an interrupt handler
	# meaning there is no need for busy waiting)
	BLOCK UNTIL myMailbox.status = myMailbox.enables

	# if we have not determined what partner to use ...
	IF NOT SET yourMailbox
		# we must have another look (this is guaranteed to succeed)
		yourMailbox = FIND token IN yourMailboxList USING enables
		yourMailbox.status = token

	# we have finished so all we need do now is wait for the
	# next interrupt
	myMailbox = oldSettings
