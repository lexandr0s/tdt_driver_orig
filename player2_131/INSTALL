Kernel mode build
=================

1. Just type make (like you might with the kernel build system)

   make ARCH=sh4 modules modules_install
    
PS. If you install your kernel in a non standard place you will need to set the environment variables:

CONFIG_KERNEL_BUILD=/opt/STM/STLinux-2.2/devkit/build/build.hms1
CONFIG_KERNEL_PATH=/opt/STM/STLinux-2.2/devkit/sources/kernel/linux

(sorry it can't work these out for itself)

User mode build
===============

1. Just type make

   make

NB.  This is an intermediate build system, this system will be updated so that one set of makefile will do for both kernel and user build, one step at a time.
